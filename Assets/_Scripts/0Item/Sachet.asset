  itemInfo: "It\u2019s a handmade Sachet from the witch, with sand and smalls inside.
    Oh, and a small piece of paper with neat handwriting: Safe and Sound. Although
    it\u2019s not as exquisite as the crafts from the city, this was stitched by
    the witch little by little. For some reason, it brings an inexplicable sense
    of comfort and calm."
