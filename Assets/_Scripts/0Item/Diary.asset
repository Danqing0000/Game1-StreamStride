  itemInfo: "When Ming left, I noticed this diary lying on the grass by the shore.
    I don\u2019t know whose it is, but the entries are quite innocent. It reads,
    \u201CI wonder when Mom and Dad will come back. I did well on my test today.\u201D
    And then, \u201CIt\u2019s the Lunar New Year, and I\u2019ve saved two plates
    of dumplings for Mom and Dad. Grandma told me to go to bed early, but I\u2019ll
    leave the night light on for them!\u201D "
